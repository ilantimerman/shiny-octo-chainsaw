                    <li>
                        Each player will receive a role card (King, Guard, Assassin, and more!) with information about their character
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Then each player will be sent into either the Red King’s Court or the Blue King’s Court
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        At court, each player must interact with other players to further their objectives
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        At the end of the round, each King will banish a number of subjects from their court and send them to the other King’s court
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        After 5 rounds, all characters will reveal their identities
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If the other King’s Assassin is in the same room as the opposite king (Red Assassin with the Blue King) that King is dead UNLESS their guard is also in the same room (Blue Guard to protect the Blue King)

                    <li>
                        <b>Role Name:</b> Simply, the name of your role. Keep this a secret to start, unless you are the King.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Loyalty:</b> Tells you which King you are loyal to. Grey roles are loyal to neither King, they have other objectives.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Ability/Curse:</b> Defines special conditions of your role. For an example of an ability, the assassin can kill the King they are not loyal to if the guard is absent or distracted. For an example of a curse, the guards must always report their true loyalty if asked.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Winning Conditions:</b> How do you win? This is your answer. Each player has at least 1 but possibly 2 ways to win. This is your objective.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Footnote:</b> Finally, at the bottom of the card there may be a note with additional conditions for your character.
