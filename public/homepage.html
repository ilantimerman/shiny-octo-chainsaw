                “The King is Dead!” -Some random Commoner
            </p>
            <p>
                News spread fast of the unexpected passing of the King. The King had never declared which of his two children would become the next to sit on the throne. The people were split and tempers flared quickly. 
            </p>
            <p>
                To prevent a civil war the King's children decided to split the kingdom. They would exchange individuals between the two kingdoms until they sealed of the kingdoms for good.
            </p>
            <p>
                Not satisfied with only half the kingdom both siblings went to the King’s craigslist and hired assassins to kill the other so that they could have the kingdom to themselves. 
            </p>
            <p>    
                Thus the board was set and went forth with their exchanges hoping their Assassin would do their job and they could have the kingdom to themselves.
