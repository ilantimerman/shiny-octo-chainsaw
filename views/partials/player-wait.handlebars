                        Each player will receive a role card (King, Guard, Assassin, and more!) with information about their character
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Then each player will be sent into either the Red King’s Court or the Blue King’s Court

                    <li>
                        At court, each player must interact with other players to further their objectives
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        At the end of the round, each King will banish a number of subjects from their court and send them to the other King’s court
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        After 3 rounds, all characters will reveal their identities

                    <li>
                        If the other King’s Assassin is in the same room as the opposite king (Red Assassin with the Blue King) that King is dead UNLESS their guard is also in the same room (Blue Guard to protect the Blue King)
